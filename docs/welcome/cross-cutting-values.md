# Cross-cutting values

Below, we list a set of cross-cutting values which this toolkit aims to set as a baseline for a shared vision between the content and tools of the following sections and align these with the _New European Bauhaus_ values and those of the _Distributed Design Platform_. While the toolkit presents the cross-cutting values in a general sense, it acknowledges that these values may need to be further defined and contextualised based on the unique experiences and characteristics of each CO initiative. It encourages readers to tailor the implementation of the values to their specific local contexts, considering the needs and aspirations of their communities.

### _Openness_

Openness refers to the mentality and approach to share and make processes transparent, replicable, and accessible. It enables the iterative and replicable nature of actions. This _openness_ extends to various strategic priorities, including open design, open science, open technology and data, and being open to the world, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.

### _Inclusivity_

Encouraging a dialogue across cultures, disciplines, genders, and ages is essential for fostering inclusivity, diversity, and a comprehensive understanding of complex issues. By promoting cross-cultural exchange, interdisciplinary collaboration, and inclusivity in all aspects, we create an environment where diverse perspectives and experiences can enrich discussions, inspire innovative solutions, and facilitate collective learning.

### _Empowerment and changemaking_

_Empowerment_ involves taking control and the increased responsibility for yourself and your environment. Fostered through collaborative approaches and openness, _empowerment_ ultimately aims to improve quality of life through _changemaking_. Our focus on these values goes beyond technological solutions, seeking transformation in individuals, communities, institutions, and cultures by shifting thinking, attitudes, values, and consciousness. We embrace community-led change as a powerful force for creating meaningful impact.

### _Co-creation and participatory practices_

_Co-creation_ is a collaborative approach that involves individuals working together on equal footing to develop projects using various methods and tools. It emphasises the use of diverse resources and ideas to create new actions. This process fosters meaningful participation and agency among citizens, enabling them to actively contribute to the design process while promoting inclusive and diverse solutions.

### _Beautiful_

Being inspired by art and culture, and going beyond mere functionality, allows for the exploration of creative and imaginative solutions that respond to deeper human needs and aspirations. By integrating artistic and cultural elements into design and innovation processes, we can tap into the emotional and aesthetic dimensions that resonate with individuals and communities, creating meaningful and transformative experiences.

### _Regenerative_

_Regenerative_ making and design principles aspire to renew and restore the systems that we are part of, rather than just replacing or devaluing them. This involves creating reciprocal relationships and embedding a _regenerative_ design culture from the beginning, with a focus on net positive benefits for both the environment and society.
