# Purpose of this toolkit

The main purpose of the _Citizen-led action toolkit_ is to provide **tools for co-creating diverse and collaborative citizen-led actions within Citizen Observatories** that are by no means restricted to a generic definition. It also aims to establish links with the _New European Bauhaus_ principles by providing tools that are aligned with its enriching and inclusive spirit. Keeping this in mind, this toolkit also provides resources which can help to foster relationships between Citizen Observatories and other communities in the local context, especially creatives, artists, local (maker)spaces and the cultural communities in the areas where the Citizen Observatories are based. This is brought about by providing tools and facilitating these connections through the [_Distributed Design Platform_](https://distributeddesign.eu/). The _Distributed Design Platform_ is a networking hub, with an established member base of different European-based cultural and creative institutions, that connects makers, designers, and creatives. The annual programming of the _Platform_ offers capacity building, networking, knowledge sharing activities and high-quality editorial content.
