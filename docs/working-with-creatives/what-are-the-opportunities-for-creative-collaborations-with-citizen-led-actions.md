# What are the opportunities for creative collaborations with citizen-led actions?

### **Description**

Creative culture and art communities spark innovation, imagination and originality when facing local and global challenges, inspiring with their unique perspectives and creative processes. Citizen observatories can benefit from the involvement of creative minds in their activities since they can facilitate new ideas and unconventional solutions. This will result in dynamic, engaging outcomes and amplified lasting impact that may resonate with more diverse audiences. This section highlights why creatives and artists can be of great help for these processes and will be the introduction to following sections in which we will see how art-related groups and creative practitioners can be part of COs' citizen-led actions.

### **Why is this relevant?**

Connecting and collaborating with local creatives can bring new ideas for how to work towards taking action for a more sustainable future. The arts and creative practices can create emotional connections and inspire people to get involved and take action, making a stronger impact, and broader reach. With this approach, innovative engagement methods can be experimented with to generate new narratives and inspire transformative change and with the help of an artistic perspective.
