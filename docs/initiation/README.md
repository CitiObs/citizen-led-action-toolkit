# Initiation

This first part of the toolkit is aimed at helping take the first steps towards collaboratively defining citizen-led actions, focusing on the active role of the citizens and communities within the CO for coming up with ideas, setting the scope of the intervention or action, as well as mapping the resources needed and available. This will be done by providing a curated selection of different co-creation tools, as well as resources from various projects and practitioners experience.
