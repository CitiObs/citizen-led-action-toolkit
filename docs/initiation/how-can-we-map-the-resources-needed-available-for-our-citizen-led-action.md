# How can we map the resources needed-available for our citizen-led action?

**Description**: An important step in the co-creation and implementation of the citizen-led action, is to have a clear understanding of the resources available to us and to be aware of those that we will require. This involves identifying the community, spaces, and tools at our disposal, as well as the data, information, communication resources that can aid us. Additionally, it can be helpful to reflect on which skills or competencies are currently present or missing in the group. This reflection can help identify new team members such as creatives, or other potential collaborators in the local context. In the [Working with creatives Section](broken-reference), we will also see how the role of creatives, artists and initiatives can complement the missing skills, know-how, resources, providing a creative perspective in a mutually beneficial exchange.

**Why is it relevant?** Mapping available and required resources will help with planning and implementation of our citizen-led action. Reflecting on the team's existing skills and competencies can highlight which other stakeholders can be beneficial to connect to. This analysis will also help in defining which resources are available already and which need to be worked on. As well, further down the line, we can identify potential collaborations, e.g. creative organisations or _NEB_ members.

**How can this be done?** The tools available in this section simplify the process of mapping required and available resources. This approach will help us comprehend the interconnected system around us, identifying potential partners and finding suitable elements that can support in the implementation of our citizen-led action. These tools focus on mapping tangible as well as human resources and skills within your citizen observatory and networks. For specific tools to help you connect with creatives and artists, check the resources in the next section.

**Tool title** Context Canvases

These canvases will help us work on analysing the challenge, the initial network of stakeholders, and the resources available in our citizen observatory. The Canvases ‘Challenge’ and ‘Lab’ can be used to better understand these factors, and align them with needs for our citizen-led action.

**Tool Title:** Ecosystem Mapping

This tool aims to provide an overview of the actors, potential participants, and how they can be part of our citizen-led action. This can help build and mobilise a rich ecosystem of both new and existing actors. Unlike traditional stakeholder mapping, this tool focuses on identifying the motivations, resources, and capabilities that are valuable for the overall ecosystem.

**Tool title:** Skill Mapping

_Team Skill Mapping_ is a process of identifying the skills and competencies of individual members within a team. The goal of the tool is to create a visual representation of the skills and expertise available. By identifying areas of strength and weakness, citizen-led actions can allocate resources more effectively, improve team performance, and achieve better results in order to protect the environment.
