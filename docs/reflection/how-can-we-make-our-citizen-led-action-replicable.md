# How can we make our citizen-led action replicable?

**Description** Drawing from the _openness_ principles that this toolkit embraces, this particular section is aimed at providing insights on the power of sharing with others what we do, how we do it, and why. The aim here is to provide readers with some guidelines that might encourage sharing the knowledge that has been gathered during the co-creation process, the tools (technical or not) that have been used or the results and highlights of the devised citizen-led action. This may, in the future, trigger curiosity or inspiration for others to implement similar citizen-led actions in their local context, or build upon what others have done, potentially in new or innovative ways that were not initially thought of. **Likewise, itâ€™s important to emphasise that in many cases, the process of co-creation is iterative, especially in order to enact the desired outcomes we might hope for. That could mean iterative for the same group, or iterative in the sense that others build upon your ideas.**

**Why is it relevant?** The actions resulting from this co-creation process will be different depending on the local context, the community and the issues at hand. In some cases, the community has envisioned a citizen-led action to protect the environment that involves some sort of technology: for instance, it could involve a device that helps display data in a visual and creative way. In other cases, there might be no involvement of technology at all, but in any case, simply documenting some insights of the processes followed, or describing the technical solutions can be very useful for our or other communities to reproduce it.

**How can this be done?** This section builds upon other sections of this toolkit, such as [_How can we boost the visibility of our action?_](broken-reference)and the[_What do we have to consider when our action takes place?_](broken-reference). Using the digital presence channels, the community could think of sharing the tools employed online, or even publishing the work formally. An additional tool could be to share any design or work in open repositories listed below.

**Tool title** Open repositories

**Description** Virtually anything can be shared in open repositories. However, if your citizen-led action involves some sort of technical design, open repositories such as _GitHub_ or _Wikifactory_ are great places where you can share your designs, devices or code.
