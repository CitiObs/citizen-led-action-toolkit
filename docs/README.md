# Welcome!

This toolkit aims to provide tools to support **citizen communities within Citizen Observatories that are motivated to take action in the context of environmental protection**. In this page, we provide a selection of co-creation tools to help **devise, organise, and deliver a citizen-led action, or series of actions, that can make an impact and bring about positive change.**
