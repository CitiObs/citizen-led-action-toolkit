# How can we boost the visibility of our citizen-led action?

**Description** This section highlights key methods that can be collectively developed with the Citizen Observatory participants and creatives to enhance visibility. A creative communication strategy and strategically utilising different communication channels, both online and offline, can effectively promote our citizen-led action and help us to both, engage in our local context, and potentially tap into broader networks such as the [_Distributed Design Platform_](https://distributeddesign.eu/)_._

Remember, a multi-faceted creative approach is key to increasing visibility. Your citizen-led action can reach a broader audience by combining a strong social media campaign, connecting to existing creative networks, offline communication efforts and online digital presence.

**Why is it relevant?** Visibility helps create awareness and generate interest among community members, potential participants, and stakeholders. It allows for effective communication of the citizen-led action's objectives, benefits, and unique features, ultimately attracting more individuals to engage and participate. Increased visibility leads to broader support, collaboration opportunities, and potential partnerships, further enhancing the action's success.

**How can this be done?**

This section provides a range of tools that can serve as guides and sources of inspiration for enhancing the visibility of your citizen-led action that can be collectively developed with creatives and artists. Whether you are seeking guidance on social media campaigns, offline communication in the neighbourhood, establishing an online digital presence, or connecting with the communication channels of the _Distributed Design Platform_, these resources will equip you with insights and tools to make your action more visible and impactful.

**Tool title** Digital Presence

Based on the _Citizen Sensing Toolkit_ from the _Making Sense Project_, _digital presence_ tools can take different forms: sometimes it can be a dedicated website, but in other cases this might not be necessary and already existing platforms such as blogs, Instagram or Twitter can be used to boost the visibility of the action campaign. Regardless of the platform used, the aim is to document the ambition of the community, the progress towards the goals, as well as the most important collective events and outcomes. Creative practitioners are important team members who can support creating creative and purposeful online presences. A digital presence can serve as a good reference for explaining the community efforts, but also recruit new participants.
