# What to consider when our citizen-led action takes place?

### **Description**&#x20;

Planning can help streamline these processes but there may be some aspects to keep in mind while implementing the citizen-led action ([see our section for planning the CO actions](how-can-we-develop-a-citizen-led-action-plan.md)). This section provides a set of recommendations that will help the CO during the process.

### **How can this be done?**

The resources available in this section have the objective of facilitating collaborative work and aiding in the implementation of citizen-led actions. Below there are some guidelines to keep in mind:

* **Document the process:** If the resources and time allow for it, it’s recommended to document the production preparation and execution implementation processes of the citizen-led action. This can be done through audiovisual recording and communication but also by documenting practical, functional, and operational aspects. This documentation serves as a research resource to make the learning from these co-creation processes visible and enables knowledge sharing to make these citizen-led actions improvable and replicable.
* **Catch-up with the group**: coordinate periodic meetings with the participants involved (e.g. creatives) to help keep everyone up to date, maybe on schedule with programmed activities to celebrate successes, and to address any issues that may arise. Depending on the length and scale of your project, these periodic meetings can be on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis.
* **Ensure collaborative work**: try to involve the community in the process, and aim for activities that generate trust and synergies, adding value to knowledge and experiences, and empowering all participants to take ownership of the citizen-led action. The value of citizen-led actions frequently resides in the collaborative production and collective practice processes, as well as the experience of realising a joint action, rather than solely the planned outcomes.
* **Embrace flexibility:** In some cases, the planned results may differ from the actual results achieved, but if the collective outcomes are satisfactory to the group, embracing flexibility will help manage the group motivation and avoid unnecessary frustration.
* **Plan for&#x20;**_**what happens after**_: In case you alter the public space, you may need to consult whether that’s possible in your local context and make decisions based on that.

Below, we feature tools that enable us to recognize and value the diversity of the action participants, fostering trust and synergy among them. Additionally, we included a guide outlining potential issues that may arise during the citizen-led action implementation, along with a hands-on task management tool that helps organise ongoing work and ensure task completion. It also offers guidelines and considerations for co-creation processes.

#### Implementation Issue Mapping

_Issue Mapping_ is a process of identifying and analysing the potential challenges that may arise during the implementation of our citizen-led action. It involves creating a visual representation of the issues that need to be addressed, along with potential solutions and strategies for overcoming them. For citizen-led actions, issue mapping is crucial because it helps to ensure that the action is well-planned and executed, and that potential problems are identified and addressed early on.

#### Critical Task Canvas

The _Critical Tasks Canvas_ serves as a means to ensure that the citizen-led action implementation is feasible within the given timeframe and budget. This is particularly crucial when aligning individual work with others and requires focus. It is a tool similar to others in the planning section, but in this case the approach is less strategic, and more focused on the production of the action itself. The canvas provides a shared reference point for the team to monitor progress and concentrate on the current tasks. Developing a routine for organising ongoing work begins with the Critical Task Canvas as the initial step.

### **Useful resources**

* [Library of resources for prototyping - DSI4EU Guide for developing DSI ideas](https://waag.org/sites/waag/files/2019-06/DSI4EU-Guide-for-developing-DSI-ideas.pdf) (section 5) _The Library of resources for prototyping &#x70;_&#x72;ovides links to different frameworks that can support the prototyping process, connecting to other reference projects and institutions. Some of them are related to useful topics such as: tinkering, electronics, coding, digital fabrication, etc.
