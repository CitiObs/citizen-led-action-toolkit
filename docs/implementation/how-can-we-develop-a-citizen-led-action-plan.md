# How can we develop a citizen-led action plan?

### **Description**

This plan outlines the proposed activities and tasks for the CO, the creatives, and other potential partners to undertake. At this point, revisiting the section on [how to define the scope of the citizen-led action](../initiation/how-can-we-define-the-scope-of-our-action.md) will help touch base and potentially tweak some results of that process, as this often occurs as an iterative process over the course of the project lifetime as it grows richer in content and form. Optionally, the CO may choose to mark the launch of the action plan through a meeting or event with the wider organisation to help build interest and buy-in from a broader group of people. With the help of the [results from the mapping exercise,](../initiation/how-can-we-map-the-resources-needed-available-for-our-citizen-led-action.md) we can also identify if the required resources and tools needed at each stage are realistic and adapt otherwise.

### **Why is it relevant?**

This process will help the CO in the process of determining resources, timelines, and activities for each phase, but also foster a sense of participation and involvement within the group. Since we are potentially involving external participants in this process (namely, creatives and artists, and maybe others), this plan will help us understand their role. Additionally, the action plan provides a visual representation of the future, outlining when results are expected and how all activities will be carried out. Finally, this plan will also help manage participants' expectations, ensuring that they are realistic in terms of what can be achieved within the given timeframe and available resources.

### **How can this be done?**

The resources provided in this section aid in the planning and implementation of the citizen-led action by facilitating the collective definition of tasks, timeframes, and available resources. Keep in mind that, in case you are involving creatives in the process, there will need to be time for the creatives to build understanding in the context and groups and organisations involved. This is also a good time for the CO to learn more about the creative’s practice and their approach. Make sure to leave time for this, maybe in the form of one (or more) induction meetings. Finally, allocate time for the creative to undertake a period of research and development of the issues, and consider involving them in the [Initiation](broken-reference) stage, so that they build familiarity and contribute to the co-creation process.

Bearing this in mind, the tools listed below contribute to effective action plan mapping while being mindful of the citizen-led action’s objectives, audiences, activities, and resources. Additionally, a guide may be used to explain in depth what an action plan entails.

#### Experimentation Canvas

The purpose of this tool is to outline the essential components that are necessary for implementing our citizen-led action. It is recommended to use it as a guide to plan our citizen-led action. The canvas provides insight into all crucial aspects of experimentation –from idea development to testing and assessments– in a visually compelling format. It must be customised for each selected solution.

#### Developing an Action Plan Guide

This section provides a guide for developing and utilising our citizen-led action plan. The guide provides useful information such as: _What is an action plan_; _Criteria for a good action plan_; _Why it is important to develop one_; _How to do it_, including practical tools such as the _Action Plan Form_, _Action Planning Tips_ and links to other complementary resources. This guide has been developed as part of The _Community Tool Box_ (_Center for Community Health and Development at the University of Kansas_), an online resource for those working to build healthier communities and bring about social change.
